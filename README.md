# City Traffic

For anyone working in city planning who needs to visualize a traffic situation, the City Traffic Project is a Web-based program that provides a simulation of traffic in a real life location, allows environemtal adjustments, and other options. Unlike other services or simulators, our product provides a simple program with adjustable situations.
Adding an screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.
